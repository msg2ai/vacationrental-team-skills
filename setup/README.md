## Usage

```bash
# Set up a single integration
bash setup/setup-gmail.sh

# Set up everything
bash setup/setup-all.sh
```

Most integrations require OAuth authentication — the script will open a browser for you to authorize.

> **Note:** You don't need all integrations. Each skill works without any connectors — integrations just make them more powerful. Pick the ones your team already uses.

## Using OpenAI Codex instead of Claude Code?

See [`CODEX.md`](./CODEX.md) for the equivalent `~/.codex/config.toml` blocks for every connector above. Same OAuth flow, same tools.
